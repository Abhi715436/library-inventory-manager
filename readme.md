# Library Inventory Manager

This is a simple Python mini-project made for my Programming for Problem Solving (Python) course.  
It is a command-line based Library Inventory Manager that helps to add, issue, return, search and view books.

The project uses Object-Oriented Programming, JSON file handling, exception handling, and a menu-driven CLI.
